CS108-Quiz
==========

CS108 assignment implementing a web application which allows user to interact, create, and do quizzes.

SET UP:

I'd recommend to git clone this repo into your current workspace, where you have you server files, etc, already set up.

Import the project into ecplise (something along the lines: import -> general -> import existing project) and it should work as in previous homework assignments.

STRUCTURE:

The app is currently organized in models, controllers, and views.
